# JSON-Modeler
An unofficial Roblox Studio plugin that lets you export and import models as human-readable .json instead of the native .rbxmx/.rbxm formats. It serializes parts, meshes, decals, welds, PBR materials, and other instances into compact JSON and rebuilds them losslessly on demandâ€”perfect for version control, sharing, or hand-editing assets.
